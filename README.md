# Description
This repository contains the final project "Symptom Significance in Diabetes Diagnosis". It includes the R Markdown file, dataset and report.
&nbsp;

A variety of techniques are applied, such as cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning, and supervised learning binary classification algorithms to a UCL Machine Learning Repository diabetes dataset in order to predict whether a patient has or not the condition based on a set of symptoms. 
&nbsp;

The project will be submitted in fulfillment of the requirements of CSC 597 (Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R) at the University of Miami.
